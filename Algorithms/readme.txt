Python Algorithms
You might be wondering why you would want to do algorithms in Python. After all, here at Coding Dojo,
we do algorithms in JavaScript, and in an interview situation you can write your algorithms in pretty
much any language you want. While that's (mostly) true, there are several great reasons to practice
writing algorithms in each new language you learn.

Writing algorithms helps you learn syntax. With a discreet goal in mind, you'll find yourself searching
Google and the Python docs for answers like a pro. Once you've thought of a way to solve a problem, it will help you discover tools you're not yet familiar with. A great way to get the maximum benefit here is by looking up other's solutions to your algorithm after you've solved it. In this way you'll realize different approaches and learn features of the language you might not have known about.
Writing algorithms gets your brain working. This is effective in any language, but doing an algorithm or two in Python every day can help you switch gears from thinking about logic in Javascript terms to thinking in a more Pythonic way.
Writing algorithms in different languages helps you learn more about programming in general. Most languages have some common tools, like logical operators, if/else statements, and loops. These are the basic building blocks. But all languages differ from others in a few or many ways. Working with syntax and basic logic can help you to think about what languages might have in common, what some differences might be and why the creators of that language made the choices they did.
Those are just a few of the benefits. In the following tabs you'll repeat some algorithms you may have already encountered, and then move on to some you probably haven't done yet. These are tough ones, and it's sometimes hard to know where to start, so don't worry if you have a tough time. If you haven't seen some of these algorithms before rest assured that you'll work on these problems again during your algorithm session.

IMPORTANT: Please continue with these optional assignments only if you have finished all the previous assignments and if you are still in the first day or two of Python. If you haven't finished the previous assignments, work on them first and come back to this when you have extra time over the weekend.

Python Swap
The swapping you've done in JavaScript probably looks something like this:

  var arr = [1,3,5,7]
  var temp = arr[0]
  arr[0] = arr[1]
  arr[1] = temp
Copy
If this code looks like a lot of work for a simple swap, good news! Python gives you a little bit prettier way to do the same swap.

  arr = [1,3,5,7]
  arr[0], arr[1] = arr[1], arr[0]
Copy
I'll just leave this here.
